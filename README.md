Developed utilizing HTML, CSS, & Javascript, I made this game as a way to better grasp and understand the key concepts behind DOM Manipulation. This project is a game built for 2 players andafter queuing in their own name, players will battle it out. However, theres a twist! Available abilities will be scaled according to the dice players roll. However, beware the Joker! The Joker may appear and skip your turn!

      <h2>Instructions 📜:</h2>
      <p>
        Each player in Random Knights will have two abilities: attack & heal.  The number displayed by rolling the dice will influence the magnitude of these abilities.  The attack factor is determined by multiplying <strong>5</strong> to the number the dice rolled, and the healing factor is determined by multiplying <strong>3</strong> to the number the dice rolled.  After successfully attacking <strong>3 times</strong>, the player's Knight is granted a power-up which sets the attack factor to <strong>10</strong> times the dice number rolled.  However, beware the Joker.  If the Joker card appears, the current player's turn is automatically skipped regardless of their health or power-up status. Press the Start button to start the game!
